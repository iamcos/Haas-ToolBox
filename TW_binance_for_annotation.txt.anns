So O
at O

we'd O
think O
of O

looking O

next O

I O
currently O
am O
putting O
that O

of O

that O
could O
be O
off O
by O
a O

any O
rate, O
the O

here O
shows O
a O
very O
potential O
path O
that O
RAMP O
could O
take O
after O
major O
milestones O
are O

especially O
if O

more O

especially O
after O

- O
RAMP O
could O
go O

"Hello O

after O
reviewing O
my O
previous O

I O
decided O
to O
create O
a O
fresh O
chart O
as O
I O
had O
put O
too O
much O
emphasis O
on O
an O
indicator O
and O
not O
price O
action. O
I'm O
currently O
trying O
only O
a O
new O
combination O
of O
Wyckoff O
and O
Elliot O
counts O
(Fractals). O

I've O
focused O
on O
only O
keeping O
VIX O
, O
RSI O
, O
and O
EMA O
as O
indicators. O
I O
still O
believe O
we O
are O
entering O
the O
5th O

move O
and O
have O
already O
created O
the O
1st O
wave O
and O
we O
are O
currently O
in O
the O
second O
wave O

I O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
entering O
too O
early O
and O
now O
have O
to O
sit O
through O
the O
current O
negative O
cycle. O
This O
is O
because O
I O
didn't O
pay O
attention O
to O
price O
action O
and O
purchased O
widespread O
candles O
with O
high O
volume O
and O
didn't O
take O
time O
to O
markup O
the O
Wyckoff O
stages. O
If O
we O
are O
now O
in O
the O
second O

we O
shouldn't O
go O
below O
88.5 O

we O
do O
we O
will O
enter O
a O

wrong. O

not! O

that O
many O
crypto-native O
hedge O
funds O
have O
recognized O
BSC O
as O
a O
“much O
cheaper O

more O
effective O
way” O
to O
access O
DeFi O
than O
stomaching O
Ethereum’s O
transaction O
fees, O
known O
as O
“gas,” O
where O

soared O
due O

is O
used O
as O
gas O
to O
pay O

BSC O
.Mancini O
speculated O
that O
BNB’s O
market O
capitalization O
might O
eventually O
overtake O
that O
of O
ether O
(ETH, O
+6.42%), O
the O
Ethereum O
blockchain O
network’s O
native O
cryptocurrency. O
Ether O
prices O
have O
tripled O
this O
year, O
to O
a O
market O
value O
just O
over O
$260 O
billion.“If O
BNB O

continue O

at O
the O

rate, O
BNB O
will O
flip O
ether O
within O
the O
next O
two O
to O
four O
months,” O
Mancini O
said.“Alt O
Season” O

It O
can’t O
be O
overstated O
that O
BNB’s O
price O
surge O
has O
come O
during O
“alt O
season” O
– O
a O
stretch O
of O
time O
where O
crypto O
traders O
have O
bid O
up O
so-called O
altcoins, O
ostensibly O
due O
to O
a O
lull O
in O
bitcoin’s O
rally.This O
is O
evidenced O
by O
recent O
drop O
in O
bitcoin’s O
share O
of O
all O
cryptocurrencies’ O
value, O
known O
as O
the O
market O
dominance O
ratio, O
to O
a O
two-year O
low.Crypto O
hedge O
funds O
trying O
to O
beat O
the O
market O
may O
also O
have O
been O
forced O
to O
invest O
in O
altcoins O
like O
BNB.Fund O
managers O
typically O
impose O
a O
“2 O
and O
20” O
annual O
fee O
structure, O
meaning O
a O
2% O
management O
fee O
of O
a O
fund’s O
net O
asset O
value O
and O
a O
20% O
performance O
fee. O
Since O
there O
are O
so O
many O
ways O
for O
investors O
to O
hold O
bitcoin O
at O
low O
cost, O
crypto O
hedge O
funds O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
“unique O
ways” O
of O
beating O
the O
largest O
cryptocurrency’s O
returns O
for O
less O
costly O
fees, O
Frank O
said.“Funds O
can’t O
just O
buy O
bitcoin O
because O
if O
the O
funds O
just O
buy O
bitcoin O
, O
it’s O
not O
worth O
it O
for O
their O
investors,” O
Frank O
said. O
“Funds O
have O
to O
go O
out O
and O
deploy O
so O
much O
capital, O
and O
binance O
coin O
is O
one O
of O
those O
larger O
coins O
that O
they O
can O
get O
exposure O
to O
and O
they O
can O
put O
a O
large O
position O
in.”Coinbase O
direct O
listing’s O
spillover O

The O
Coinbase O
stock O
listing O
might O
be O
another O
potential O
driver O
of O
BNB’s O
gains.While O
Binance’s O
CZ O
has O
told O
CoinDesk O
that O
the O
company O
does O
not O
plan O
to O
go O
public, O
the O
token O

might O
be O

"Hello O
traders, O
Here O
is O
my O
plan O
for O
DogeUSDT. O
Doge O
has O
left O
its O
range O
and O
is O
in O
an O
upward O
trend. O
RSI O
is O
over-extended O
on O
the O
4hr O
so O
I O
expect O
either O
a O
quick O
pullback O
before O
continuation O
or O
a O
deeper O
retest O
of O
an O
earlier O
order O
block O
before O
more O
upward O
momentum. O
VIX O
is O
flat O
and O
EMA's O
are O
fanning O
out. O
Just O
need O
to O
time O
entry. O
There O
shouldn't O
be O
a O
deep O
retracement O
at O
this O
stage O
- O
keep O
watch O
on O
the O
candles O
and O
make O
sure O
a O
ratio O
of O
5:1 O
bullish O
to O
bearish O
candles O
exist O
and O
that O
vix O
does O
not O
rise O
as O
we O
want O
a O
steady O
increase O
of O
price. O
Price O
should O
remain O
above O
45 O
degrees O
if O
strong. O
Goodluck O

$355 O

Now O
basing O

we O
can O

a O

develop O
