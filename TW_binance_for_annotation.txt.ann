"A quick look at #Polkadot (#[@DOTUSDT#Coin*], #Binance, 4HR):
Price broke the upper resistance of the pennant pattern earlier today, April 17, hitting its ATH at $48.36.Since then, the 1HR chart shows what to me seems to be a confirmation. I opened a position at $44.63.If DOT manages to flip R1 into support, we can try to reach TP1. If it does not hold, price might go back down to S1 or to the EMA200/S2.

Dear traders as I told before I am expecting the next move to be bullish and if you are a short-term trader you can wait for a breakout of this trendline to enter your positions with a target of 68000$.
"Two points about Binance coin
1. If the price can break the red break pattern upwards, a new uptrend will begin.
2. If the uptrend line is broken from the bottom, buying BNB will be risky."
"Binance Coin Price Forecast: BNB on verge of 25% upswingBinance coin BNB BNBUSDT Long to 720?Binance Coin price has formed a bull flag on the 4-hour chart.

Whales have accumulated a lot of BNB lately, despite increasing prices.
Binance Coin price has been outperforming the entire market for the past two months, reaching a market capitalization of $90 billion. Many analysts believe BNB could even overtake Ethereum , which stands at a $280 billion market cap.Binance Coin price needs to surmount key level for massive breakout
On the 4-hour chart, BNB has established a bull flag with its resistance trend line formed at $550. Binance Coin bulls currently try to defend the lower boundary support and aim for a rebound toward the upper trend line .
a conservative Binance (BNB) price prediction, saying the token could trade at $500 at the end of 2021, $800 by the end of 2022 and $1,000 by the end of 2025. Wallet Investor has a one-year forecast of $684 and a five-year forecast of $1,326 for Binance"

"The chart for Loopring ( LRCBTC ) looks beautiful now that a higher low is being cemented.After the February 2021 bullish wave, LRCBTC went on to retrace and after some consolidation, signals are coming up pointing to higher prices.LRCBTC recently moved above EMA50 and there was no strong volume while the correction took place, signaling that the bears are not strong.Now that the consolidation phase is almost over, prices moved above EMA50/EMA10, we are very likely to see next a bullish jump.Condition for change

"COTI / USDT: Technically, we are still in the downtrend here.
Coti just had some positive news, and looks like the project is developing pretty fast: with the debit cards, partnership with Cardano (ADA Pay) and so on.
However, after the previous massive move, correction is still in place.
We need to make sure we have really broken out of the trendline and the down trend is over.
Fundamentally, I think this project has good potential, medium market cap and nice partnerships on the horizon.Happy trading everyone! And please, always dyor :)"

"A quick look at #Chromia (#CHRUSDT, #[$Binance#Exchange*], 4HR):
Price timidly broke the upper resistance of the wedge pattern on April 8, but it has also been trading within a range since March 16.CHR needs to break R1 before aiming to TP1.If rejected at R1, price should go back to the EMA200 or S1 and, if that does not hold, to S2.

BNB since its recent massive bullish rally market has provided us with a nice correction, during the correction on the 4hr timeframe market has formed this nice falling wedge pattern.... we are currently testing and rejecting the bottom trendline of this wedge , nice long opportunity here IF my entry rules are met.
One of the probable scenarios.
"A quick look at #Ren (#[@RENUSDT#Coin*], #[@Binance#Exchange*], 4HR):
There are two way I can look at this chart: A) Ren broke out a descending triangle on March 26; B) Ren broke out yesterday from a triangle. Either ways, price has been ranging since March 26.Let's wait to see if the price bounces back from the upper side of the triangle, or for a confirmation of the upper resistance at $1.11-$1.10 flipping into support. If confirmed, we could see #REN finally move higher. If not, price might go back down and find support at $1.

"Hello traders, my prior chart on LRC[$USDT#Coin*] lacked detail. here is a new much deeper chart markup analysis. Good Luck!
Comment:
Here are unfilled POI - points of interest. They are often called light tunnels or holes where price hasn't overlapped and most often will need filling for harmony to be fulfilled.
Comment: Use the light tunnels to place orders for buy and sells. So at the top when price touches that light tunnel we'd think of selling or looking for a continuation of price action - becoming support or acting as resistance, etc. In the lower regions, we'd be looking for the same principles.
Comment:"
"Trading suggestion:
"". There is a possibility of temporary retracement to suggested support line (523.12).
. if so, traders can set orders based on Price Action and expect to reach short-term targets.""Technical analysis:
. [@BNBUSD#Coin*] is in an uptrend and the continuation of uptrend is expected.

"Bitcoin recently took out its 62,000$ Resistance creating a new all time high, and right now from a Technical Analysis standpoint we are coming to a crucial point. On the Chart, even the price has already broken out two times downwards from this Upwards Sloped Channel, I think it is still quite important.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Parallel ChannelsParallel Channels are quite common in Cryptocurrency aswell as other financial markets. In this pattern the price moves upwards or downwards zig zagging between a slopped parallel channel . This signifies a battle between the buyers and sellers until eventually we see a breakout above or below the ""trendlines"" which are the lines formed when the price makes 2 obvious ""swings"" or touches on each side of the pattern, forming the sloped structure.When price finally ""breaks out"" of the structure, below or above; we can see a continuation in that said direction, unless the price quickly moves back inside the pattern, in which then traders who were looking to capitalize on the breakout are quickly taken out of their trade as the price reverses the other direction inside the pattern again, a successfull breakout is usually marked with a retest, which is a confirmation of the change of trend after breakout of the pattern.Parallel Channels are made up of these key characteristics:-Minimum 2 Touches on Each Side with obvious swing points
-Should form Straight Edges
-Upwards sloping channel shows a Bullish Trend until broken
-Downwards sloping channel shows a Bearish Trend until broken---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Market TrendThe dictionary definition of trend: a general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving.In financial markets the direction the price of a asset is moving is referred to as the trend.Markets are made up of several different kinds of trends, and it is the recognition of these trends that will largely determine the success or failure of your long and short-term investing.There are 3 key trends in a Markets:1. Bullish (upwards, buyers in control) (higher lows, higher highs (HL, HH)
The Mark Up phase is an uptrend or bullish trend .2. Bearish (downwards, sellers in control) (lower highs, lower lows (LH, LL)
The Mark Down phase is an downtrend or bearish trend .3. Consolidation /Sideways (sideways, direction & control undecided temporarily)
Re accumulation & Re distrubution phases are consolidation phases or ""pauses"" in the market before continuation of trend.This upwards slanting Parallel Channel is a great example of a Bullish Market Trend, in a Bull Market the characteristics of the trend usually show obvious Higher Lows and Higher Highs consecutively, showing us that Bitcoin is still in a strong upwards trend as long as we keep printing the HL, HH (Higher Lows & Higher Highs).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ConclusionTo put it simply, if the price can Find Support (Stay Above and Bounce Off) the 61200-61900 area we may see the price confirm that it is back inside the upwards sloped channel, if this occurs many buyers may flock in for a speculated push to the $70,000-$80,000 region or higher, if we were to lose this area though Bitcoins fast paced upwards movement may be cut short as the Upwards Channel breaks down.

"Binance coin is very bullish . For next move up is necessarily break a resistance and close above this resistance. You can see strong support level around 530USD - is important to hold this level for next uptrend. TIP - don´t short this coin because Binance doesn´t like it :)
Order cancelled: BNB didn´t break a resistance, so we will take another trade."
"Waiting for the LONG signal: [@RLC / USDT#Coin*]
Ideal entry would be 2.2 - 2.4 area if bounces of the trendline."
Personally waiting for a reclaim of $560 and a break of trendline to long. Bars pattern gives general idea of how I want to play it, although not expecting it to move that fast.
"Key points:
Volume is increasing.
Important resistance - high chances of flipping it.TP1 short-term - 50% run.
TP2 juicier, mid-term - 300%.Project still delivering."

"Recently [@BNB#Coin*] gained popularity by 100% due to the massive pump in just few moths which pumped over 200% majorly because of the [@BNB#Coin*] COIN BURN.
According to the white paper they will burn the con four times. after the burn process we saw the surge and the pump in prices which actually brought in more investors, [@BNB#Coin*] is now back on stable trading but now consolidating.
If theres a breakout above 560 there might be another uptrand to surge.

"I've already written quite a lot on RAMP's fundamentals. You can search for those here or on my profile but now I want to switch focus to RAMP's potential parabolic path with the launch of rMINT imminent.rMINTThis will be the singular moment that really defines the main feature product of RAMP DeFi and what we've all been waiting for. The co-founder recently announced in an AMA on telegram that they are finishing up their beta testing with their VC backers (ParaFi Capital) before proceeding with the public rollout of rMINT next week. I currently am putting that launch date as April 21st - but of course that could be off by a day or two.At any rate, the chart here shows a very potential path that RAMP could take after major milestones are reached - especially if there are more integrations with other major chains like DOT / UNI / LINK / ADA, etc and if a full launch on Coinbase's trading platform especially after the COIN IPO today - RAMP could go stratospheric and this could be a potential 50x return if everything aligns correctly.Of course I want to remain level headed so I am maintaining my $5 PT on RAMP by month-end if everything launches on schedule and there are no delays. This parabolic path is based on several other cryptos that I've modeled the curve after."
"Hello traders, IOSTUSDT has broken out of its range. It might be possible to look for another entry on the next pullback. If it's entering a new trend the pullback should be shallow and quick. Good luck!
Comment: Trade target!"
I am waiting 4x in one month. thanks.
"From the ascending triangle pattern STMX looks to be re-testing the rising lower trendline support. If it can maintain this key area of support and continue validating the pattern through consolidation within the triangle, then a breakout would be more likely to the upside. In this case, I would expect this breakout to occur in late April/early May as long as BTC and ETH remain stable.Swing Trade Plan

"Hello traders, after reviewing my previous chart, I decided to create a fresh chart as I had put too much emphasis on an indicator and not price action. I'm currently trying only a new combination of Wyckoff and Elliot counts (Fractals).
I've focused on only keeping VIX , RSI , and EMA as indicators. I still believe we are entering the 5th wave move and have already created the 1st wave and we are currently in the second wave retracement. I made the mistake of entering too early and now have to sit through the current negative cycle. This is because I didn't pay attention to price action and purchased widespread candles with high volume and didn't take time to markup the Wyckoff stages. If we are now in the second wave retracement we shouldn't go below 88.5 Fibonacci, if we do we will enter a much stepper down cycle and my count is completely wrong. I hope not! Good luck!

"Why Binance Coin Hit All-Time High (and $86B Valuation) Ahead of Coinbase ListingIt's not equity, it's an exchange token. But it sure is mooning, apparently linked to the recent success of Binance Smart Chain.Why wait for the Coinbase listing of its shares on the Nasdaq? There’s already a way – in cryptocurrency markets – to bet on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.It’s a digital token linked to the success of Binance, which boasts a higher spot trading volume than Coinbase, according to the data site CoinGecko. The token, binance coin (BNB), has surged 14-fold in price this year, for a market value of $86 billion.Some cryptocurrency investors see BNB as a way to get excess return over a simple purchase of bitcoin ( BTC , +5.07%), whose doubling in price this year looks almost paltry by comparison, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data firm The TIE, told CoinDesk in an interview.“Funds can’t just buy bitcoin , because if the funds just buy bitcoin , it’s not worth it for their investors,” Frank said. Binance coin “is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to, and they can put a large position in.”Binance press officials said they didn’t know why BNB has rallied so dramatically this year. The token’s price “is not something that can be controlled,” according to a spokesperson.But cryptocurrency analysts said that Binance’s recent business moves, including launching a blockchain network to compete with Ethereum for a share of the decentralized finance market, known as DeFi, have helped to boost the BNB token’s prospects.Unlike Coinbase’s soon-to-be-issued shares, BNB tokens confer no equity ownership rights. Binance is a closely-held firm, still led by its founder, Changpeng Zhao, often referred to by his initials, CZ.Instead, BNB is considered an “exchange token.” It can be used to pay fees on various Binance trading platforms, sometimes entitling the payers to discounts, or even as a currency on blockchain networks sponsored by the exchange. Investors in the token are essentially betting on its supply and demand , which effectively translates to a bet on the success of the Binance ecosystem.The rise of Binance Smart Chain
Binance Smart Chain ( BSC ), a less decentralized public blockchain that’s considered a competitor with the Ethereum blockchain, has been quite successful. With transaction fees that are about 35 times cheaper, BSC has overtaken Ethereum in the first three months of 2021 for daily unique active wallets, according to DappRadar’s 2021 Q1 overview report on April 1.In March, the total value locked in Venus, the top decentralized money-market protocol on BSC , surpassed that of some of the most popular DeFi projects on Ethereum , including Uniswap and Compound, DappRadar wrote in its report, citing data from Defistation.The huge success of Binance Smart Chain has played a significant role in BNB’s rapid growing value. As a “discount token,” BNB offers discounts for trading on both Binance’s decentralized exchange (Binance DEX) and Binance, according to Nick Mancini, research analyst at Trade The Chain.The TIE’s Frank told CoinDesk that many crypto-native hedge funds have recognized BSC as a “much cheaper and more effective way” to access DeFi than stomaching Ethereum’s transaction fees, known as “gas,” where rates have soared due to network congestion.BNB is used as gas to pay for DeFi deployment to BSC .Mancini speculated that BNB’s market capitalization might eventually overtake that of ether (ETH, +6.42%), the Ethereum blockchain network’s native cryptocurrency. Ether prices have tripled this year, to a market value just over $260 billion.“If BNB and ether continue to grow at the same rate, BNB will flip ether within the next two to four months,” Mancini said.“Alt Season”
It can’t be overstated that BNB’s price surge has come during “alt season” – a stretch of time where crypto traders have bid up so-called altcoins, ostensibly due to a lull in bitcoin’s rally.This is evidenced by recent drop in bitcoin’s share of all cryptocurrencies’ value, known as the market dominance ratio, to a two-year low.Crypto hedge funds trying to beat the market may also have been forced to invest in altcoins like BNB.Fund managers typically impose a “2 and 20” annual fee structure, meaning a 2% management fee of a fund’s net asset value and a 20% performance fee. Since there are so many ways for investors to hold bitcoin at low cost, crypto hedge funds have to come up with “unique ways” of beating the largest cryptocurrency’s returns for less costly fees, Frank said.“Funds can’t just buy bitcoin because if the funds just buy bitcoin , it’s not worth it for their investors,” Frank said. “Funds have to go out and deploy so much capital, and binance coin is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to and they can put a large position in.”Coinbase direct listing’s spillover
The Coinbase stock listing might be another potential driver of BNB’s gains.While Binance’s CZ has told CoinDesk that the company does not plan to go public, the token ecosystem might be benefiting from speculation over Coinbase’s value."
"Hello traders, Here is my plan for DogeUSDT. Doge has left its range and is in an upward trend. RSI is over-extended on the 4hr so I expect either a quick pullback before continuation or a deeper retest of an earlier order block before more upward momentum. VIX is flat and EMA's are fanning out. Just need to time entry. There shouldn't be a deep retracement at this stage - keep watch on the candles and make sure a ratio of 5:1 bullish to bearish candles exist and that vix does not rise as we want a steady increase of price. Price should remain above 45 degrees if strong. Goodluck
Comment: If doge is too aggressive, place 50% now and another at the next accumulation!

"Hello Traders. RSI is in the buy zone and the price has moved out of the range and the vix is flat. 2:1 / 3:1 target or 1.618 Fibonacci level. Good luck!
Trade closed: target reached
Comment:"
Hello traders, We might have a chance here to gain some profits during this Re-accumulation period. Targets are on the chart. Good Luck!
"As see in the image BNB-USDT played perfectly on the previous ATH $355 support and resistance flip.
Now basing around $560s we can see a new flag develop and lower bound support to watch for at $480.Do you think it keeps going to $1000??
